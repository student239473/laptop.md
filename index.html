<h2 id="about-albert-einstein">About Albert Einstein</h2>
<p>Albert Einstein (1879â€“1955) was a theoretical physicist, widely recognized as one of the greatest scientific minds in history. Born in Ulm, Germany, Einstein revolutionized the field of physics with his theories of relativity, which reshaped our understanding of time, space, and energy. His most famous equation, ( E = mc^2 ), established the relationship between energy and mass, laying the groundwork for modern nuclear physics.</p>
<p>Einstein&#39;s work extended beyond science; he was a staunch advocate for peace and civil rights. After fleeing Nazi Germany in the 1930s, he settled in the United States, where he worked at Princeton University. He continued to contribute to science, philosophy, and politics until his death in 1955.</p>
