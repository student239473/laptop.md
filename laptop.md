## What is a Laptop?

A **laptop** is a portable personal computer featuring an integrated display and keyboard, designed for mobility while maintaining functionality similar to a desktop computer. Laptops are powered by rechargeable batteries and compact hardware, enabling users to work, study, or enjoy entertainment on the go. The first laptops appeared in the early 1980s and were significantly bulkier and less efficient than their modern counterparts. Modern laptops are equipped with high-resolution screens, powerful processors, and versatile connectivity options, meeting the demands of diverse user groups.
